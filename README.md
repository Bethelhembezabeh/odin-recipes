# odin-recipes
This project is a website containing multiples recipes. 


The main goal of this project is to put the lessons I hav learned in TOP's "Introduction to html" lesson ans well as get used to the command line.

Some of the skills I anticipate to practice and put to work are:
- Navigating my file system using the command line
- Manipulating files and Directories using the command line
- Using git to manage this project and my progress
- Making github commits efficiently and effectively 
- Creating meaningful commit messages
- Creating an effective web file system
- Practicing different html elements I've learned
