# odin-recipes
This project is a website containing multiples recipes. 


The main goal of this project is to put the lessons I have learned in TOP's "Introduction to html" as well as get used to the command line.

Some of the skills I anticipate putting to work are:
- Navigating my file system using the command line
- Manipulating files and Directories using the command line
- Using git to manage this project and my progress
- Making github commits efficiently and effectively 
- Creating meaningful commit messages
- Creating an effective web file system
- Practicing different html elements I've learned

Learning goals for TOP's "CSS Foundations" Lessons
- After completing each lesson and sub-lessons, to take what I have learned and practice it by applying it to this recipe  
    website
- Practice how to apply CSS styles, expand and stylize the website
- Practice working with selectors, CSS properties, cascade of CSS
